# cpp_library

### Code from various sources (much of it is not written by me) for use during competitions.
### Repo is public per the requirement that the code is publicly avaliable before the start of competitions.
### Code that was not written by me is cited (usually just via a link).
### Sources for algorithms in code written by me are also cited.
